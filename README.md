## Details : 
**Name** : Harshavardhan Bajoria</br>

**Country of Residence** : India</br>

**Experience Level** : Student</br>

## Theme : 
A transparent healthcare application to reduce corruption and bring trust into the industry. 

## Problem Statement :
The whole treatment process in India after the patient is admitted into the hospital involves a lot of challenges and obstacles for the patient and it's family which is getting exploited by some hospitals and doctors to fulfill their desires.
* There is no transparency present in the system because of which the patient's family is not able to get the right update about the treatment process and tests.
* The whole authority is provided to the hospital because of which the family doctor is not able to contribute much towards the correct decision.
* The lack of transparency leads to exploitation of the patient which makes the patient incur heavy charges.
* With no proper validation service the bills and charges of tests, treatment, medicines are overpriced and filled with anomalies.
* The lack of power to the patient's family makes the hospital and doctors the central authority which gives some greedy doctors a scope to exploit the patient.
* No portal where the patient's family can view the daily reports, bills, treatment procedures on a daily basis which can lead to unnecessary tests to increase the bill amount.

## Solution :
**Medicancy** is a solution to the above problems in the healthcare industry which needs to be addressed. It will be making the whole journey of the patient and patient's family easy, simple and corruption free. It will revolutionize the way treatment takes place and how the after-journey of a patient works out.
* This application will bring transparency into the system because of which the patient's family will get the correct and verified details about the bills, tests, reports and treatment procedures.
* The authority will now be distributed between the patient's family doctor and the hospital doctors equally before any treatment is initiated along with any test or medications that are prescribed.
* The complete transparency will lead to correct and necessary treatment only which will save them from exploitation and corruption thus reducing the heavy charges incurred on them.
* The bills test will get validated before final uploading on the application which will help the patient pay only the correct amount and detect anomalies to take further actions.
* The patient's family gets a powerful portal where all the reports are. bills and tests are displayed in a user-friendly manner which will help them understand the treatment procedure, get consultants and take action if required.
* The authority will also be distributed to the patient and the family doctors ( without their acceptance no test or treatment can be initiated till there is an emergency). This will help the patient get the best treatment and reduce the scope of greedy doctors and clinics. 


## Tech Stack :
The following tech stacks can be used in order to build the application and using Microsoft Azure get the security we require. 
* **React, Javascript, CSS** to build the website.
* **Microsoft Azure** services to host the website and get the IT infrastructure required.
* **Microsoft Azure Cloud Functions** to take actions as required.
* **MongoDB database** to store and manage the data which is uploaded, processed in relational databases.
* **Microsoft Power BI platform** to generate reports, charts and analyze data.

## Methodology :
The interface for the hospital will :
* Allow the receptionist to get the patient's past records and data directly from the application.
* Allow the hospital to add doctors as required from the list of registered and verified doctors after their approval for a treatment procedure.
* Allow the hospital to upload bills, receipts as required directly to the patient's treatment data.
* Give the hospital a user-friendly portal to keep complete track of the patient treatment, records, bills and reports.
* Allow the hospital to easily verify the bills and detect anomalies and errors.

The application works in the following way inside :

The interface for patient will :

* Allow the patient to add their trusted family doctors to the treatment procedure which gives them authority in the decision making of the new treatment procedure and tests.
* Allow them to upload bills which they have paid to be verified and cross checked with hospital records.
* Allow the patient to easily detect anomalies in price and test reports to take action.
* Be a central authority in the decision making of the treatment procedure unless it's a case of an emergency.
* Get reports, treatment details, doctors incharge and bills on a daily basis in a visual and easily understandable form.
* Be aware of all the treatment details, doctors taking the decision even for future records. 
* Easily store all their treatment, doctor, medicine details in a secure and protected database which can be accessed instantly.

The application will work the following way inside :

  </p>

The feature that will reduce scope of exploiting the patient :
* The portal will only allow the doctors incharge of a treatment to be involved in decision making.
* All the incharge doctors (by hospital and patient) will be given equal authority and have to agree together to allow a new treatment procedure or tests which will avoid unnecessary charges.
* The daily tests, medicine bills will be cross verified with the test and medicines prescribed which will not allow the clinic to add extra medicines and tests to the list. 
* A provision for an emergency will be made where the doctor present can take the decision alone. 
* With the model of shared authority no single doctor will be responsible for a patient and will allow the family doctor to also look  for a correct treatment.

The application will work the following way inside for this concept:
