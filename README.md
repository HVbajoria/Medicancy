## Theme : 
Designing a healthcare application to reduce corruption and bring transparency into the industry. 

## Problem Statement :
The whole treatment process in India after the patient is admitted into the hospital involves a lot of challenges and obstacles for the patient and it's family which is getting exploited by some hospitals and doctors to fullfil their desires.
* There is no transparency present in the system because of which the patient family is not able to get the right update about treatment process and tests.
* The whole authority is provided to the hospital because of which the family doctor is not able to contribute much towrads the correct decision.
* The lack of transparency leads to exploitation of the patient which makes the patient incur heavy charegs.
* With no proper validation service the bills and charges of tests, treatment, medicines are overpriced and filled with anamolies.
* The lack of power to the patient's fammily makes rhe hospital and doctors the central authority which gives some greedy doctors a scope to exploit the patient.
* No portal where the patient's family can view the daily reports, bills, treatment procedures on a daily basis which can lead to unneccessary tests to increase the bill amount.

## Solution :
**Medicancy** is a solution to the above problems in the healthcare industry which needs to be addressed. It will be making the whole journey of the patient and patient's family easy, simple and corruption free. It will revolutionalize the wayh treatment takes place and how the after-journey of a patinet works out.
* This application will bring in transparency into the system because of which the patient's family will get the correct and verified details about the bills, tests, reports and treatment procedures.
* The authority will now be distributed between the patient's family doctor and the hospital doctors equally before any treatment is inititated along with any test or medications that is prescribed.
* The complete transparency will lead to correct and neccesary treatment onlyy which will save them from exploitation and corruption thus reducing the heavy charges incurred on them.
* The bills, test will get validated before final uploading on the application which will help the patient pay only the correct amount and detect anamolies to take further actions.
* The patient's family gets a powerful portal where all the reports. bills and tests are displayed in a user-friendly manner which will help them understand the treatment procdure, get consultant and rtake action if required.
* The authority will also be distribuyted to the patinet and the family doctors ( wityhout their acceptance no test or treatment can be initiated till there is an emergency). This will help the patient get the best treatment and reduce the scope of greedy doctors and clinics. 


## Tech Stack :
The following tech stacks can be used in order to build the application and using Microsoft Azure get the securitry we require. 
* **React, Javascript, CSS** to build the website.
* **Microsoft Azure** services to host the website and get the IT infrastructure required.
* **Microsoft Azure Cloud Functions** to take actions as required.
* **MongoDB database** to store and manage the data which is uploaded, processed in relational databases.
* **Microsoft Power BI platform** to generate reports, charts and analyze data.

## Methodology :
The interface for the hospital will :
* Allow the receptionist to get patient's past records and data directly from the application.
* Allow the hospital to add doctors as required from the list of registered and verified doctors after their approval for a treatment procedure.
* Allow the hospital to upload bills, receipts as required directly to the patient's treatment data.
* Give the hospital a user-friendly portal to keep complete track of the patient treatment, records, bills and reports.
* Allow the hospital to easily verify the bills and detect anamolies and errors.

## Social Impact / Novelty :
This application will revolutionize the whole world. It will change the topics taught in business schools, change the way business takes place, make the payment of taxes more hassle-free, fast and secure.
* The application will allow the buyer to verify the price of the product and hence protect them from being cheated.
* The application will allow everyone to easily file their income , profit/loss statements and get detailed reports,charts and know their spending behaviors which can help them take actions as required to improve their life.
* The application allows everyone to easily get to know the payable tax amount and pay it without hassle or requirement of an accountant. This will bring uniformity and cost them the bare minimum.
* As the application uses blockchain, no one can modify the data once entered. This will reduce the scope of corruption and the emergence of black money in the market which will reduce inflation and help the world become a better place.
* The government will be benefited as they will get the money circulated and will help them effectively and in less time audit the tax return filed by the individuals.
* The manual effort and scope of error will be greatly minimized which will help in accurate transactions that take place between the individuals.

## Future Scope :
Iif this application is adopted by the mass and used for the day to day transaction it can :
* Help make the transaction between a buyer and the seller more secure, transparent and hassle-free with amount and MRP verifier and integrated payment options.

* With the reduction of black money the world will become a much better place as the wealth will not get concentrated into the corrupt hands. This will help reduce inflation and boost the economy to provide more opportunities and better living to everyone.
* The application can also be integrated to help the farmers, small artists to get to know the right value in which their product is being sold and hence get the right amount they should be paid for the useful products they have been growing, producing for so many years.
* In the future, we can see this application become a new product like laptops and mobile phones which we use everyday. This will bring in a new innovative, bright future which will be corruption-free and filled with opportunities.
